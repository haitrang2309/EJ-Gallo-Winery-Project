To run code do the follow:
1. Make sure you are connected to Gallo's VPN (in order to access Hana database)
2. Update the directory on line 18 in Updated_Final_Combined_Code.py to where the folder was unzipped
3. Final results are printed in the console

*** NOTE: Make sure all the code and csv's are in the same folder directory.
*** The ingredience table query takes 1 hour to run so for now we use the csv file but the query is in the Hana_Connection.py
